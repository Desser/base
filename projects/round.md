## Business Model
Round â€” decentralized ethereum-based Esports platform. The platform allows its users to
interact with the Round smart contracts. In competitive eSports matches on the platform you can
use Round token as stake. Users can send their stakes to a decentralized escrow represented by the
smart contract. Once our decentralized result verification system (RVS) has processed the match the
smart contract will handle both the matchmaking and reward settlement.
