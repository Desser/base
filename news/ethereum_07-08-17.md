### Project: [Ethereum](../projects/ethereum.md)
### Date: 02 August 2017
## Summary
Bitfinex had announced Ethfinex – a community & information hub to facilitate Ethereum-based discussion, analysis & trading.
The vision for Ethfinex is rooted in the event of the past year when Bitfinex was hacked and 119,756 Bitcoins were stolen from customer accounts.
The Ethfinex platform will reflect the nature of the Ethereum community itself: building smart contracts and decentralisation increasingly into everything it does, 
and providing tools and modules necessary to interact with, and contribute back to other projects in the ecosystem.
The decentralized aspect of Ethfinex can be explained easily. All trades on the platform will be processed by a high liquidity pool on-chain without Bitfinex ever having control of the funds.
The company is confident that they can create a “laboratory” for creating decentralized exchange protocols. 
Additionally, the company plans to issue an Ethfinex token which will not be sold through an ICO.
