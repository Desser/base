### Project: [Dash](../projects/bitcoin_cash.md)
### Date: 09 August 2017
## Summary
* Due to political and economic turmoil in Venezuela, which has bad effect on state currency, attractiveness
of cryptocurrencies increases. Notably, the value of the bolivar has devalued to the point where World of 
Warcraft gold is worth more. That's why local Dash community started a proposal to fund a series of Dash 
conferences in Venezuela in order to increase awareness and adoption for digital currency. Discover more

* Overstock (major retailer) now accepts various altcoins for payment, including Dash. 
Overstock customers can transact via Shapeshiftâ€™s native API easily using Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Monero, 
Litecoin, Ethereum, and more.
