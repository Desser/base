## Summary
* BitcoinFundi has added Dash trading pairs, making it the second African exchange to support Dash.
* Cointed has activated dozens of Dash ATMs across Austria, bringing the global total past 50.
* Dash, the payments-focused digital currency, has received approval from the Dash community to 
employ the services of Bugcrowd, a leader in crowdsourced security testing. The partnership means 
thousands of security researchers will be incentivized to identify critical software
vulnerabilities within Dashâ€™s code and present them to the Dash Core Team for remediation.
