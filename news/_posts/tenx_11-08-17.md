### Project: [TenX](../projects/tenx.md)
### Date: 11 August 2017
## Summary
TenX Team is working on a solution to exclude PAY tokens stored on exchanges and in the internal TenX contract from receiving part of the token holders' reward.
This reward was designed as an incentive for token holders and equals of 0.5% of the entire payment volume on the TenX payment platform initially on a monthly basis.
Which means possible greater rewards for the token holders.
