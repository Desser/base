## Summary

Qtum Skynet - the second public testnet for the Qtum blockchain. The previous testnet was named Sparknet. The testnet is only for testing, as such, its tokens hold no value and production applications should not yet be created on the testnet blockchain. All tokens aqcuired during the testnet will cease to exist when the mainnet is released which actually has tokens which hold value. The purpose of the public testnet is to allow developers to begin testing and developing applications, allow early adopters to see a preview of how the network will behave, and for the Qtum development team to run several load tests which are not directly comparable when done on a private and controlled network.

The major features and improvements implemented in Skynet include:
The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional
The Smart Staking Protocol is complete to our specifications (Sparknet was missing a feature called MPoS which makes attacks more expensive to execute)
A very early and basic smart contract GUI has been implemented that can be used for creating contracts, sending data and Qtum to them, and checking their status by executing them locally.
