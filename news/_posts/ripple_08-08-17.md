## Summary
   Main target is enterprise sector, such as banks, financial accounting services and payment service provider as most promising for growth possibilities. Those plans may become more real thanks to close cooperation with regulators world-wide. One of key drivers in this area is RippleNet - blockchain solution for global payments in scale of enterprise sector. Advantages achieved by using Ripple infrastructure, like using XRP for internal transactions, which enables realtime speed for international transfers.  
   
   Among other solutions in Ripple ecosystem xCurrent facilitates processing of global payments between banks.  xRapid act as a buffer source of liquidity for payment providers. Payment providers can also take advantages of xVia for payments across various networks. 
On the other hand there is opininon, that aiming at enterprise solutions and banking, Ripple goes against principles of decentralized cryptocurrency fundamentals trying to help the banks and governments. With true motive in just selling XRP to banks.  

   At all events Ripple heads on to provide a single frictionless experience to send payments globally.
