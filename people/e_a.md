## About
E_{a} had started out as an undergraduate chemistry student. Sophisticated computational tasks that he faced during the preparation to his bachelor thesis induced him to dive into the art of programming. The scientific way of thinking allows E_{a} to see keen and obvious solutions where nobody else could guess to look for them.
A sci-fi fan, he owns the first edition of Isaac Asimov's “Foundation” signed by the author.
